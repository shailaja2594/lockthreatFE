## About the guage
The gauge is based on Jake Trent's D3 based work. Original codepen can be found here. https://codepen.io/jaketrent/
I created this simple library to wrapped it as an reusable angular 2 component.
All value and rages are represented in percentage so you can map it easily to your own data range.
You can also give any number of data ranges on the dial. 

## Installation

To install this library, run:

```bash
$ npm install ng2-gauge-with-color-band --save
```

## Consuming the library

Once you have published your library to npm, you can import your library in any Angular application by running:

```bash
$ npm install ng2-gauge-with-color-band
```

and then from your Angular `AppModule`:

```typescript
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

// Import your library
import { ColorGuageModule } from 'ng2-gauge-with-color-band';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,

    // Specify your library as an import
    ColorGuageModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

Once your library is imported, you can use its components, directives and pipes in your Angular application:

```xml
<!-- You can now use your library component in app.component.html -->
<h1>
  {{title}}
</h1>
<color-band-gauge fxFlex="25%" [options]="gaugeOptions"></color-band-gauge>
<color-band-gauge fxFlex="40%" [options]="gaugeOptions1"></color-band-gauge>
```
## Gauge Options

```ts
  gaugeOptions: IGaugeOptions = {
    valuePercent: .65,
    bandColor: ['#56bf36', '#ff9c04', '#f03333'],
    bandPercent: [.5, .75, .1],
    minValue: 0,
    maxValue: 120,
    unit: 'KM/h'
  };
  gaugeOptions1: IGaugeOptions = {
    valuePercent: .65,
    bandColor: ['#56bf36', '#ff9c04', '#ffc52b', '#f03333'],
    bandPercent: [.5, .6, .75, .1]
  };
```
